  title: "Opportunities in AI"
  desc: "AI, similar to electricity, is a General Purpose Technology with applications in all corners of the economy and all areas of society. In this presentation, I will describe some major technology trends in AI:
 <ul>
 <li>Generative AI, beyond being a powerful consumer tool (such as ChatGPT) is also a powerful developer tool that is enabling new applications in many industries, such as  finance, logistics, education, and healthcare.</li> 
 <li>Low code development platforms, including ones built on generative AI, is enabling more AI applications to be built not just in the tech sector, but in the “long tail” of AI applications.</li>
 <li>Technology developed and proven out in text processing is also making its way to other types of data, especially image data.</li> 
 </ul>
 <br>I will describe how these technology trends are creating new opportunities for everyone to create and use AI, and share some tips for doing so.
 <br>Finally, I will discuss the risks posed by AI, and how we can move forward to embrace its many benefits while mitigating its harms."

  title: "[Workshop B1] Vision-and-Language Research and Applications: Towards Universal Multimodal Intelligence"
  desc: "Vision-and-language research has received much success recently, enabling improved performance in many downstream multimodal AI applications. This talk will introduce the efforts from Salesforce Research in advancing state-of-the-art vision-and-language AI from two perspectives: library development and fundamental research. For the library, we introduce LAVIS (4.3k stars), a one-stop solution for vision-language research and applications. LAVIS is a central hub that supports 40+ vision-language models with a unified interface for training and inference. For research, we introduce our line of research work including ALBEF, BLIP, BLIP-2, and the latest InstructBLIP. In particular, this talk will focus on BLIP-2, a generic vision-language pre-training method that enables frozen LLMs to understand images."

  title: "[Workshop B2] Harvest Your Alpaca In Your Environment: LLMs Local Training and Hosting (Advanced For WoG Data Analysts / Data Scientists)"
  desc: "Large Learning Models (LLMs) are powerful and with game-changing capabilities. We will introduce LLMs, their use cases, strengths, and limitations. LLMs come in various sizes and some of them can be trained and hosted locally. We will discuss model selection, emphasising that size isn’t everything, and explore smaller LLMs like LLaMa, Alpaca, Vicuna, and Dolly. We will focus on demonstrating how to effectively finetune a LLM by leveraging libraries such as PEFT and LoRA with a hands-on session."
