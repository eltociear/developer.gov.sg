<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>To uplift our government's Data Science and AI capabilities for public good.</p>

<h3>DSAI Products</h3>

<p>To support the digital transformation of government through Data Science & AI, we partner agencies on data projects, building quality AI products and data and analytics platform tailored for government agencies and a series of capability development initiatives to upskill public officers and uplift public agencies.</p>

<p>Check out some of the products and platforms here.</p>

<h3>Playbooks and Additional Resources</h3>

<p>Along the way, we have also developed resources and methodologies to address some of the common challenges faced by agencies in their transformation efforts.</p>
<p>Some of these best practices have been condensed into the different playbooks to address the needs of agencies based on their individual needs relevant to the data maturity of their organisation.

<h4>Analytics by Design</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Analytics By Design (ABD in short) is a new methodology that GovTech is piloting to improve the analytics-readiness of projects. A project that is analytics-ready will allow Data Scientists, Analysts and even business teams to quickly get down to analysis and derive insights faster. Conversely, a project that is not analytics-ready will encounter issues on data extraction, or risk having dirty and incomplete data derail the analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be applied broadly, be it building products & platforms, running programmes, or drafting policies. It helps you become more data-driven in your work, and makes the data work for you by uncovering actionable insights to improve your project’s prospects for success from the start.

<h4>Data Transformation Playbook (Coming Soon)</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    This playbook provides public officers and the wider audience a guide on how to embark on their data transformation journey in their agency and shares a range of broad strategies that enable data transformation that have been implemented in a Government context.

<h4>Public Sector AI Playbook</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    While many agencies in the Government have started to scope AI projects, significant value has yet to be delivered from the use of AI. Two key gaps identified in the strategy were (i) the lack of awareness of major AI use cases and (ii) the lack of ops-tech capabilities to initiate AI projects by public officers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The National Artificial Intelligence Office (NAIO) and Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) have developed a Playbook on AI. This playbook provides public officers, especially non-technical officers, a guide on how AI can be adopted in their area of work and shares a range of AI projects implemented throughout the public service. This playbook will enable you to:
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the basic concepts of AI.</li>
	  <li>Learn how to start an AI project.</li>
	  <li>Identify opportunities to adopt AI in your agency.</li>
	  <li>Leverage central support for AI adoption.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Data Literacy ePrimer (Work in Progress)</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    We are moving into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and one of the most defining aspects of it is the way organisations are using data to completely revamp their business models, strategies and operations. 
  </p>
  <p>
	As with all industrial revolutions, they leave no sectors unturned. There is a great deal of hype around what AI can do, and uncertainty around where it can be applied effectively. 
  </p>
  <p> 
	In this ePrimer series, we take a step back to explore what all these really means to someone operating in this new digital era by reducing the technical jargons into layman understanding. 
  </p>
  <p>
	In this series of 5 modules, you will learn about:
	<ol>
	  <li>What are some applications of Data Science and AI and what are some of the strengths and weaknesses applying them?</li>
	  <li>Why is Data so critical to the whole endeavour to get Data Science and AI right?</li>
	  <li>How does doing Visual Analytics well in turn improve the quality of the data we collect, and enhances the data stories we tell and dashboards we build?</li>
	  <li>Why do the algorithms and techniques behind Data Science and AI work the way they do?</li>
	  <li>How do you sharpen problem statements to be solvable through Data Science and AI techniques and applications?</li>
	</ol>
