This is a summary of the steps required to onboard SearchSG:

1. Contact the SearchSG team at [enquiry@search.gov.sg](mailto:enquiry@search.gov.s){:target="_blank"}

The SearchSG team will gather relevant information such as URLs to blacklist, and issue you a unique ID.

2. Insert searchconfig.js into your site

Add the SearchSG code snippet into your siteâ€™s header. 

3. Determine the location of your search bar widget

Add in another code snippet to demark where the search bar will be.

4. Adjust the Content Security Policy (CSP) rules on your website, if necessary.

This will allow SearchSG resources to be loaded on your page.
