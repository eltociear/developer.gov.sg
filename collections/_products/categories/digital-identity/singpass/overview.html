<p>Singpass, Singapore’s National Digital Identity (NDI), is a strategic national project implemented and managed by the <a href="http://www.tech.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Government Technology Agency (GovTech)</a> which is a part of the <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/about-smart-nation/sndgg" target="_blank">Smart Nation Digital Government Group (SNDGG).</a> SNDGG was formed in 2017 to drive Singapore’s Smart Nation vision and is housed under the <a href=" https://www.pmo.gov.sg/" target="_blank"> Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).</a></p>

<p>As a foundational digital infrastructure of Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, Singpass has empowered citizens, created opportunities for businesses, and transformed the capabilities of government agencies. Through Singpass, government agencies and businesses can provide a convenient and secure platform for users to conduct transactions. At the same time, its inclusive design and accessibility features ensures that no resident is excluded in Singapore’s Smart Nation.</p>

<p>To ensure that Singpass can continue to meet the needs of our citizens and businesses, it is consistently enhanced to both expand and improve its suite of services. One of Singpass’ latest features include the digital IC system that was rolled out in 2021. Accessible via the Singpass App, the digital IC allows residents to digitally transact with government and business services without the need for a physical identification. It consists of a resident’s latest official photograph, a holographic lion crest to prevent image tampering and screenshot spoofing and masking of the resident's identification number which can only be accessed via user authentication.</p>

<p>As of February 2022, over 700 organisations offering more than 2,000 services have adopted Singpass. This means, Singpass boosts over 4.5 million users, which consists of 97% of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 15 and above. To add to this, more than 350 million personal and corporate transactions are facilitated by Singpass every year.</p>
