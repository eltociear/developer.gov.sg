### The Singpass app enables government agencies and businesses to provide users with seamless access to digital services
Services from over 700 Government agencies and private sector organisations are available through the Singpass app. By integrating with Singpass APIs, government agencies and businesses have enabled users to check their CPF balance, apply for HDB flats, perform internet banking, or manage their insurance policies with ease. The app also enables login shortcuts to popular and last-used digital services, and handy access to personal information registered with the Government, facilitating easier and faster transactions. Users can also digitally sign documents such as applications for insurance policies through the Singpass app. 

### Identiface enables government agencies and businesses to provide users with a secure biometric authentication platform

Identiface’s Face Verification feature allows users to verify their identity securely and conveniently via a face scan. This allows government agencies and businesses to simplify a users’ customers journey. Furthermore, by incorporating a Presentation Attack Detection technology in the authentication process, Identiface reduces impersonation attempts. It operates based on a privacy by design principle with users’ facial image only being stored for 30 days in government databases.
