### Wide audience reach

All Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and FIN holders aged 15 and above are eligible for Singpass. As of Feb 2022, government agencies can reach over 3.5 million Singpass app users through a single campaign.

### Send secured messages as a trusted source 

Push notifications are securely sent to the Singpass app, which helps to prevent phishing attempts. Users have to authenticate themselves before reading the notification and thereafter, directly login to the desired eService via the messageâ€™s Call-to-Action.

### Customisable messages with actionable campaign statistics

Notify allows for a variety of message outputs for different types of content, including images and links. Agencies can also track read rates and click-through rates. Average read rates of 30-50% for agency campaigns have been reported, although this depends on the type of messages sent. If the message remains unread for a period of time (as determined by the agency), agencies have the option to automatically send a reminder via SMS to alert the user.
