### Email Personalisation Tool

This web-based eDM platform comes with modules that allow the creation and tracking of email campaigns in a variety of ways, such as:

 - The targeting of email campaigns to audience groups based on specific criteria, such as interests indicated in newsletter signups
 - The ability to reach out to citizens who have both interacted with an agencyâ€™s website and read at least one newsletter article on an upcoming campaign
 - The ability to reach out to less active citizens to inform them about a new service that is relevant to their needs.
