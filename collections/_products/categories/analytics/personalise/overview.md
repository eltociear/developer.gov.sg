Personalise, or Percy, is an email personalisation tool developed by GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) to help public agencies offer personalised Government services to citizens. It is part of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](/singapore-government-tech-stack/){:target="\_blank"}.

By using Personalise to customise agency emails sent to citizens, agencies can ensure that citizens will have an improved experience with Government services, leading to quicker and more satisfying decisions and outcomes. This in turn leads to increased usage of Government products and services.

Email personalisation leads to more effective targeting and engagement strategies which help strengthen Government-citizen relationships, thereby building trust in the Government.

### Key Benefits
