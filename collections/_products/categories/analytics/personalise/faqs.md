  - name: How is Personalise different from Postman and MailChimp (or other equivalents)?
    description: >
      What sets Personalise apart from is that:
      <br/>
      <br/>1. It allows you to segment your users in your audience list (e.g. based on interest, gender, demographics, etc.). That means with just one audience list, you can send multiple EDMs based on which segment your users belong to. This will help you engage your users on a more personal level.
      <br/>
      <br/>2. You can create an HTML EDM with the email builder feature. This feature is intuitive, with drag-and-drop functions to quickly create your EDM in just a matter of minutes.
       <br/>
       <br/>3. Personalise provides an in-depth view of your campaign/email performance (e.g. the number of users that unsubscribe, soft-bounce, hard-bounce, and more).
       <br/>
       <br/>4. You can work collaboratively with your team members. This means that everyone in the team can view the campaign/EDM performance and can make business decisions with the available data. There is no need to wait for the owner of the campaign/EDM to manually export and share the data.
