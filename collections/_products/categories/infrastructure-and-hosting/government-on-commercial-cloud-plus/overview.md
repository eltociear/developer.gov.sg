GCC+ is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP)-hosting environment compliant for consolidating and benefiting the hosting of government agencies’ systems and data with Confidential classification.

It replaces the Government Private Cloud (GPC), which is reaching end of support in mid-CY2024. Compared to GPC, GCC+ offers new business and technical benefits to agencies and Central.

GCC+ is the first of its kind in-country CSP arrangement for government use, and is part of the Singapore Government Tech Stack.

### Key Benefits

- Agencies can tap on a better range of certain cloud services
- Better security posture vis-a-vis the technology used in GPC
- More frequent patching and enhancements
- Faster provisioning of resources
- Greater agility and faster scaling to meet demand changes
- More automation leading to faster fulfilment of service requests

### Pricing

Pricing for GCC+ would be similar to or lower than that for GPC.  Refer to the government intranet for pricing (accessible via GSIB laptops).

### What's Next

GCC+ is launching in 2023 for onboarding by government agencies. It will replace the Government Private Cloud (GPC), which will reach end-of-support in mid-2024.

Agencies will be adopting the lift-and-shift model for timely migration from GPC to GCC+, and as subsequent step, refactor/redevelop/optimise their applications and data for GCC+.
