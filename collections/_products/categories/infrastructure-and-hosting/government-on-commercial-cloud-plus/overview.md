GCC+ is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP)-hosting environment compliant for consolidating and benefiting the hosting of government agencies’ systems and data with Confidential classification.
It replaces the Government Private Cloud (GPC), which is reaching end of support in mid-CY2024. Compared to GPC, GCC+ offers new business and technical benefits to Agencies and Central, which are described below. 
GCC+ is a first of its kind in-country CSP arrangement for government use, and is part of the Singapore Government Tech Stack.
