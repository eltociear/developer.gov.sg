GCC+ is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP)-hosting environment compliant for consolidating the hosting of government agencies’ systems and data with Confidential classification

It replaces the Government Private Cloud (GPC), which is reaching end of support in mid-2024. Compared to GPC, GCC+ offers new business and technical benefits to government agencies.

Agencies may subscribe to GCC+ services for hosting Intranet or Internet application systems with Confidential security classification.

GCC+ is the first of its kind in-country CSP arrangement for government use, and is part of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack](/singapore-government-tech-stack/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Key Benefits

- Agencies can tap on a better range of certain cloud services
- Better security posture vis-a-vis the technology used in GPC
- More frequent patching and enhancements
- Faster provisioning of resources
- Greater agility and faster scaling to meet demand changes
- More automation leading to faster fulfilment of service requests

### Pricing

Pricing for GCC+ would be similar to or lower than that for GPC.  Refer to the government intranet for pricing (accessible via GSIB laptops).

### What's Next

GCC+ will be available in 2023 for onboarding by government agencies.

Agencies should adopt the lift-and-shift approach to ensure timely migration from GPC to GCC+. Lift-and-shift refers to keeping the agency systems broadly intact, and rehosting the systems in the GCC+ environment. Such lifted-and-shifted systems should be refactored or redeveloped subsequently, to optimise them to run better on GCC+.

Refactor means to redevelop only the relevant part(s) of the agency's system. Redevelopment, on the other hand, impacts the entire agency system to make it better-suited for the GCC+ environment.

More details about GCC+ will be revealed soon.
