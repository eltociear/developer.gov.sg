### Use of cryptographic technology for veracity

Digital travel documents are checked against a blockchain hash value to ensure that they are authentic.

### Trusted provenance 

Notαrise verifies the legitimacy of digital travel documents according to travel policy requirements and validates the authority of the issuing entity.

### Strong identity assurance

Identities of travellers are validated via Singpass, Singapore’s National Digital Identity, to prevent fraud and impersonation.
