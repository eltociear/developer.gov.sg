  - name: How long does it take to transcribe a file?

  - name: Sometimes the transcripts do not seem to be accurate, with a number of errors and missing texts. Why is that so?
    description: >
      The performance and accuracy of speech-to-text transcription is typically measured by Word Error Rate (WER) that summarises the errors in a transcript including insertion, deletion and substitution. In reality, the accuracy varies according to use case scenario and is determined by a number of factors such as the fluency, the enunciation and speakersâ€™ accents. For use case in a formal speech setting with professional audio system and articulate speakers, the WER could be as low as 10%. For meetings and focus group discussions that involve many speakers with different accents and fluency, poor audio system and significant background noise, the WER could go as high as 30% to 40%. Therefore, the accuracy for each transcription task varies and sometimes one transcript could have more errors than the other.
  - name: Can Transcribe detect multiple languages and transcribe multiple languages in a task?
    description: >
      Transcribe does not support auto detection of language and language switching in a task. After the language for the task is selected, the transcript would be in the selected language only. Any other languages used in the same task would not be transcribed
