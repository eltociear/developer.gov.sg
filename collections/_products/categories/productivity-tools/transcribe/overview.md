Transcribe is a Speech-to-Text (STT) platform with auto-transcription technologies and localised STT services across various speech models and data classification. Its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enable integration with other systems. 

Transcribe can be used to produce transcripts of interviews, speeches and meeting minutes. Given the confidential nature of government documents, the platform is designed to be secure, yet easily accessible. Transcribe aims to improve the productivity of public officers with these unique offerings: 

- Available on both Internet and the Intranet environment for flexible use 
- Hosts up to Restricted and Sensitive Normal data 
- No additional registration process required for all public officers 
- Open to addressing agencies' needs through collaboration on operational use cases and model adaptation

Other key features include:
- Live and media file transcription 
- Workspace collaboration across Whole-of-Government 
- Multi-language support

First used to produce a Hansard report in a Parliament Sitting, Transcribe was able to integrate with the existing workflow and generated a full verbatim transcript in 1.5 hours – a process which used to take 2.5 hours. 

In its pilot phase, Transcribe received positive feedback and a 75% satisfaction rate from a pool of 100 users from 10 government agencies. 

In Q1-2022, registration achieved more than 200% year-on-year growth. There were close to 6,000 tasks completed, which amounted to more than 1,600 hours of transcription length produced. As of Q2 2022, Transcribe has a total of 1,032 registered users across 72 agencies.

Users can look forward to new transcript editing and speaker diarisation functions by end of 2022.
