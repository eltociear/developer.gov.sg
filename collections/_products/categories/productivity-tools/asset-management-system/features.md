### Full lifecycle tracking of assets and contracts

AMS can track all types of assets and contracts, regardless of financial value and type.  It can operationalise your agencyâ€™s assets by tracking the full lifecycle, including important milestones such as loans and faults/maintenance management.

### Integration with Finance and HR systems

AMS automatically syncs with the Finance and HR systems of public agencies for capitalised assets and user account provisioning.

### Full-fledged Contract Registry

AMS is supported by a full-fledged contract registry which allows for contract milestone tracking, granular tracking of consumption of contractual services, and time & threshold alerts that are automatically sent to contract managers and asset custodians.

### Compliance by design

The workflows and controls are built into AMS, allowing public agencies to comply with financial & ICT rules.

### Mobile channel

AMS has a mobile touchpoint that allows public officers to perform stocktaking of assets using RFID.
