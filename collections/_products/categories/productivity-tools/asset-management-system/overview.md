The Asset Management System (AMS) is a single system for public agencies and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to track all types of assets and contracts, regardless of financial value and type. 

Designed to be user-friendly for public officers, the system can also track other asset types such as files and evidence that have a lower financial value but high operational value. It also interfaces with the financial and HR systems of government agencies for capitalised assets and user account provisioning.

AMS was conceptualised to address the difficulties that government officers have experienced due to the low visibility of cross-agency assets across different categories and types (e.g. fixed asset, low value, no financial value but high operational value assets and consumables).

In addition, it helps with manpower-intensive asset tracking tasks by employing radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology for asset stocktaking.

GovTech partnered with the Ministry of Financeâ€™s (MOF) agencies (Accountant General Department and VITAL Shared Services) to build in standard workflows for AMS. Thus, AMS enables agencies to be compliant with Finance & ICT governance frameworks by default.
