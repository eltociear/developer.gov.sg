description: Government Agencies will progressively include technical assessments in quality evaluations of tenderers bidding for Government ICT projects.

### Overview

Government Agencies would be including technical assessments in quality evaluations increasingly. This aims to uplift the digital capabilities of Singaporeâ€™s ICT industry, which supports Government projects, and to provide a more objective validation of the competency of teams bidding for Government projects. The technical assessments would be an added criterion for quality evaluation, in addition to relevant certifications and track record, which Agencies may include in their quality evaluation.

As a start, technical assessments for 2 roles - **Solution Architects** and **Software Developers** working on application projects are currently administered.

**A phased approach is taken to introduce the assessments in tenders progressively for other roles. Updates will be shared on this page by Q4 2023.**

### Implementation of Technical Assessments

For projects covered under this technical assessment framework, tenderers will be required to send a specified sample of personnel who will be a part of the project when awarded to undertake the technical assessment during the tender evaluation phase. Results will contribute to the quality score of the Tenderer. Upon awarding the project, the successful Tenderer would need to send their remaining team members under the specific roles for the assessment. These may vary according to project requirements. Tenderers should refer to the tender specifications and attend tender briefings (if any) to understand the specific requirements and details of the technical assessment.

Personnel who have passed the technical assessment will receive a certificate that will be valid for 3 years and will not need to re-attempt this assessment during the period.
