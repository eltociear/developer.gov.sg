Encryption is an important aspect of protecting data in the cloud using cryptographic keys. Data is encrypted at rest and decrypted for processing. Managing cryptographic keys is thus pivotal to securing the confidentiality and integrity of data in the cloud. 

This article covers the securing of the key management lifecycle for cloud data protection and the risks and mitigations. 

### TYPICAL LIFECYCLE OF A CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY

In the next series, we delve into examples of cryptographic technologies that we can leverage in the cloud to protect the cryptographic keys and, ultimately, our data encrypted with these keys.
