### Overview 

Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been a significant increase in individuals serving Stay-Home Notices (SHN), leave of absences (LOAs), and quarantines. This means manual enforcement of the above measures to ensure compliance is no longer feasible. Thus, Homer was created to provide a broad-based system for self-directed periodic check-ins to complement manual check-ins. This alleviates the load on enforcement operations and deters SHN/LOA/quarantine violations amidst Singapore’s fight against COVID-19.

### What is Homer? 

Homer is a location reporting system for individuals serving SHNs or home quarantines. It exists as an app that periodically alerts individuals throughout the day to request their location by sending over a custom URL and directing users to a location declaration platform. Homer also collects data on the backend and presents this information to enforcement agencies allowing them to better prioritise their manual checks.
