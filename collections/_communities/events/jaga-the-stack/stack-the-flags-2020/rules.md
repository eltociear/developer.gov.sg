| Type of Award                                           | Additional Considerations |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Top Prizes (Top 3 teams of each category)               | The prize moneys for each category will be distributed equally among the registered members of the winning teams\^.<br /><br />For example, team XYZ consisting of 4 members, wins the top prize (SGD 15,000) for the open category. The prize sum of SGD 3,750 will be transferred to the bank account of each individual member. The bank account number is to be provided by each individual member.<br /><br />The attribution and award of the Top Prizes will be at team level. |
| Coins of Honour (Top 10 teams of each category)         | The GovTech CSG C01N and certificate will be delivered via courier to a local representative of each of the winning teams. If a local representative is unavailable, alternative arrangements may be made with that team separately. |
| Mastery Awards (across all participation categories)    | The Mastery Awards will be in the form of a prize money that will be disbursed to a single bank account submitted by each of the winning teams.<br /><br />The prerequisite of the awards will be detailed [here](/communities/events/jaga-the-stack/stack-the-flags-2020/prizes){:target="_blank"}.<br /><br />The attribution and award of the Mastery Awards will be at the team level. There are multiple awards for the Mastery Awards, and each award will only have 1 winning team. The winner of each award will be the best performing team (across all 3 categories) that successfully meets the award’s corresponding requirements. |
| Awesome Write-ups (across all participation categories) | The Organising Committee will assess each competition entry based on the assessment rubrics detailed [here](/communities/events/jaga-the-stack/stack-the-flags-2020/prizes){:target="_blank"}. Upon successful completion of the competition, GovTech plans to release the competition code, write-ups and materials via a public GitHub repository (referred to as the **“Competition GitHub Repository”**), please see the [General Terms and Conditions](/communities/events/jaga-the-stack/stack-the-flags-2020/general-terms-and-conditions){:target="_blank"} **for the STACK the Flags Capture The Flag (CTF) event and competition** for details. The Competition GitHub Repository will contain the details of the competition, the CTF challenges and the competition write-ups that were nominated as the best write-ups by GovTech. The details and contents of the Competition GitHub Repository shall be in the sole discretion of GovTech.<br /><br />The attribution and award of the Awesome Write-up will be at team level. Only the challenges detailed [here](/communities/events/jaga-the-stack/stack-the-flags-2020/prizes){:target="_blank"} are eligible for the Awesome Write-up awards. The details of the eligible challenges will be made known at a later date. Each specific challenge will only have 1 winning entry. The winning entry for the corresponding challenge will be the one with the highest write-up score (across all 3 categories) based on the assessment rubrics. |

All fees, taxes, and/or surcharges for the prizes shall be borne by the winners/recipients.
