</p>
<p>
  Learn about how the coupling of Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) can improve supply chain security and reduce software supply chain incidents. Or how common Application Security (AppSec) challenges can be prevented through good security practices. Attendees will also gain insights on concrete steps that can be taken to build a strong foundation for a more secure future.
